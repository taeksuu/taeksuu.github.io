I'm an M.S./Ph.D. student advised by [Hanbyul Joo](https://jhugestar.github.io) in Visual Computing Lab of Seoul National University. My current research interests lie in 3D computer vision, especially in generating realistic 3D humans. I received a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Seoul National University.
