I am an undergraduate student majoring in Industrial Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering in Seoul National University. Currently, I am doing my full-time internship in SNU Vision Computing Lab with [Hanbyul Joo] ("https://jhugestar.github.io")

Research Interest
======
With deep interest in the wide applications deep learning algorithms can be used, and its ability to solve the previously unsolved problems, conclusively, I desire to change peopleâ€™s lifestyle dramatically by forming an AI system that could behave like humans or even surpass us. For this, I am currently working on experiencing various state-of-the-art deep learning models in numerous areas, trying to understand, implement and improve them, hoping one day I could create new models in such areas.
